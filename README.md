# Tabs Split Layout

It is a library to create a split layout with tabs. Think of it as a library for VScode's split layout. It's the same concept but is OSS and has pluggable architecture.

- Minimal dependencies (depends on the `lit` library)
- Supports types (written in TypeScript)
- General purpose - it makes no assumptions about the content
- Open source - install and use, regardless of the kind of the project.

## Installation

```sh
npm i -S @pawel-up/tabs-split-layout
```

## Usage

See usage details in [the documentation](docs/readme.md).
