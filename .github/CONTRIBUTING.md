# Contributing to Tabs Split Layout

First of all, we are happy you want to contribute to our open-source project. It is a community-driven project, and we are open to your input. Before you start, let's clear some things so your contribution is accepted without unnecessary delays.

## Start with an issue report

Before you start working on any code or architecture, please report an issue in the repository. It is crucial for open projects so the community can participate in the discussion. Also, the project is being developed so we can predict upcoming changes. This way, we will also be able to direct you in the right direction, like telling you where you can find relevant codes. See below for more information.

## Code the change

### Code and PR

After creating an issue report, you are now enabled to code the change. After you finish, **introduce relevant** tests**. We can't accept PRs that contain an untested code. After that, create a PR to the repository. We will get back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to mention us directly in the PR so we will get a notification from GitHub.

### Things to consider

- Introduce changes that other users will benefit from
- Significant architecture changes may take longer to be accepted, given the complexity of the dependencies.
- We are here to help. Ask us questions about the architecture or how stuff works.

That's it. We are thrilled to see you contributing to the project. Drop us a message in case you have any questions.
